- 👋 Hi, I’m @SethiosAcademie, my real name is Sethios lorick,
  I am a fervent defender of sharing resources in a community,
  both in terms of knowledge and services and tools.
- 👀 I’m interested by new technologies, especially those based on artificial intelligence
  and big data. This pushed me to seek solid and professional foundations in system programming,
  both web and mobile applications.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and to broaden my programming skills to have
   a good devstack: 🪴Nextjs; Reactjs, Tailwindcss, framer-motion, etc.
   are my dev tools for the frontend of my apps to give a good user experience
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies and partners seeking to digitize
   and optimize their digital platform, developers and programmers for knowledge sharing.
